# Camping Checklist App

## Motivation

As a camping lover, I wanted to create an app which my camping crew can use to to view, edit, and check off items as we prepare for camping. I learned and utilized Firebase to store the data which everyone can access together. It was also a great practice planing and structuring React components to keep the codes clean and reuseable.
